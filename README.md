# Sauce

Sauce is an open source MIDI controller and VST similar to the NI Maschine, and MPC. Inspired by [this discussion](https://www.native-instruments.com/forum/threads/fao-ni-software-developers-i-have-a-solution-to-allow-users-to-define-their-own-chords.339431/).

**Star, or watch for updates**


## Ideas

* Provide functionality similar to the MPC, taking inspiration from both
* Extend features. Make it easy to allow anyone to extend and improve
* We need a VST. It's open source, JUCE may not work due to licensing. Ideas?
* Hardware design needs doing. 3D printed ideally, or cheap premade kits
* Custom board? Or use existing such as Teensy and friends. Initial idea will likey be based on a microcontroller. Easier for everyone.
* Needs USB MIDI, MIDI ports, CV ports, USB for transfering files/config etc ... Anything else?
